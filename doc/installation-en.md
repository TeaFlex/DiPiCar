# Installation of DiPiCar
 
### Prerequisites 

You must have built your car before installing the software !

#### (LAN mode)

If you want to benefit of the LAN mode, it's highly recommanded to follow the steps below first. You can also perform them after the full installation but we can not guarantee that it will work correctly.

Fristly, you have to connect the Raspberry pi to the network that you want the car to be connected to. 

1. Use the command `sudo raspi-config`.
2. Go to *System Options > Wireless LAN*.
3. Select your country (if it wasn't already done).
4. Enter the SSID of your network.
5. Enter the password of the access point.
6. Finally, reboot your Raspberry pi by running `sudo reboot`.

### Download DiPiCar
You must first download the package trougth GitHub. You can access all the releases [here](https://github.com/TeaFlex/DiPiCar/releases).
We suggest you to use wget to download DiPiCar directly to your Raspberry pi, as such:
> Replace all [version] by the release that you're interested in.

```
wget https://github.com/TeaFlex/DiPiCar/releases/download/[version]/dipicar-[version].deb
```

### Enable the camera module
After downloading it, you have to enable your camera module in order to be able to stream video. Execute `sudo raspi-config` and then go to *Interface Options > Camera > "Yes"* and then reboot with `sudo reboot`.

### Install the package
When your Raspberry pi has reboot, you can then proceed to the installation of the previously downloaded package. In the same folder as the package, run this:
>Replace [version] by the version that you downloaded.

```
sudo apt install ./dipicar-[version].deb
```

After that, all the configuration scripts will run automatically. You'll then be able to enable the dipicar sevice like this:

```
sudo systemctl enable dipicar.service
```

and reboot your Rasberry pi.

```
sudo reboot
```

Enjoy driving ! ðŸš—
